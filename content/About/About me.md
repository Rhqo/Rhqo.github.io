This is a **ByungHa Ko**'s blog.

I would like to gain a deep understanding of the latest research trends and various algorithms for solving problems, especially in the field of Vision Language Models(VLMs) and Visual Foundation Models(VFMs).

```python
byungha_ko = {
	"name":        고병하, Byungha Ko
	"affiliation": Hongik University
	"interests":  [Computer Vision, 
		       Multi-modal Understanding ]
	...
	"username": Rhqo
}

class Person:
	def __init__(self, info): 
		self.info = info
		 
	def get(self): 
		return self.username + ".github.io"

Rhqo = Person(byungha_ko)
Rhqo.get()
```
